<h2> Relax anytime with Savasana</h2>	
<p>
Prepare youself for Savasana. Lie down on your mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe
slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use your
arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for
all you have in life. Namaste.
